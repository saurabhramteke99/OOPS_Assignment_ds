        "Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, encapsulation is primarily achieved through access modifiers. These access modifiers define the visibility or accessibility of attributes and methods within a class. Python uses three types of access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)Public (default access modifier):\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Protected attributes and methods are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses. While these can still be accessed outside the class (because Python does not strictly enforce access control), it’s a convention to treat them as protected and to avoid direct access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, protected attributes and methods are prefixed with a single underscore (_).\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Private :\n",
        "\n",
        "Private attributes and methods are meant to be accessible only within the class. To denote that an attribute or method is private, a double underscore (__) is used as a prefix. In Python, private variables are name-mangled so that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",

It takes a cls parameter as its first argument, which refers to the class itself, rather than self which refers to an instance. Class methods can modify class-level attributes and are commonly used to define factory methods, or methods that return instances of the class in a particular way.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans : 1)Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows you to use the same interface for different underlying forms. This means you can reuse code and avoid redundancy. For example, a function or method that works with any class type can be written once and used for many different object types. Instead of writing separate code for each class, polymorphism enables you to write general code that works for multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Simplified Code and Increased Readability: Polymorphism simplifies your code by letting you call the same method on different objects, reducing complexity. This also makes the code more readable because you don’t need to remember different method names for each class. Instead, you can use the same method name, regardless of the type of object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If you have a method draw() for multiple shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, polymorphism allows you to call draw() on a list of shapes without knowing their exact types.\n",
        "```\n",
        "shapes = [Circle(), Rectangle(), Triangle()]\n",
        "for shape in shapes:\n",
        "    shape.draw()  # Calls the appropriate draw method for each shape\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "3) Extensibility: Polymorphism facilitates easier code extension. You can introduce new classes that extend the existing functionality, without modifying the existing code. The new classes can define their own version of methods that override the parent class’s behavior, allowing you to add new features or behaviors without altering the existing system.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)Flexibility and Maintainability: Polymorphism enhances flexibility, as it allows the program to select the appropriate method or function at runtime. This ability to choose a method dynamically based on the type of the object allows your program to adapt to new requirements without needing significant rewrites.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Achieving Dynamic Binding: Polymorphism allows dynamic method binding (or late binding), meaning that the method that gets executed is determined at runtime, based on the object type. This is particularly useful when you are working with collections of objects of different types and want to call the same method on each, but with different behaviors.\n"

        "1)Calling Parent Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of super() is to allow a subclass to call methods from its parent class. This is particularly useful when overriding methods in the subclass and still wanting to call the method from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Avoiding Explicit Parent Class Names:\n",
        "\n",
        "super() helps to avoid explicitly referring to the parent class name in the method calls, making your code more flexible and maintainable. This becomes important in more complex inheritance hierarchies, where multiple classes might need to be accessed dynamically.\n",

        "3)Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the method resolution order is important when dealing with multiple inheritance. super() follows the MRO and ensures that the correct method is called in the inheritance chain, especially when multiple classes are involved.\n",

        "3) Automatically Called:\n",
        "\n",

        "4) When Is It Called?:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. With inheritance, polymorphism allows a derived class to override methods from its base class, enabling different behavior for objects of the derived class while still using the same method names from the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of how polymorphism works in Python with inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Method Overriding:\n",
        "When a subclass inherits from a base class, it can override methods of the base class to provide its own specific implementation. This is a key feature of polymorphism — the same method name can have different behaviors depending on the class of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dynamic Dispatch:\n",
        "Python determines at runtime which method to call based on the type of the object, not the type of the reference (the variable that holds the object). This is called dynamic dispatch or late binding.\n",

        "Que_24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method chaining in Python (and in object-oriented programming in general) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement, where each method returns the object itself (or another object) to allow further method calls to be chained together. This is possible because the methods are designed to return the object instance (self in the case of class methods), which allows you to chain multiple calls on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Method Chaining Works:\n",
        "When you define methods in a class that perform some operations and return the object itself (self), you can chain the calls. Each method call performs an operation and then returns the object, so that you can call the next method in the chain."

        "Ans: Purpose of __call__:\n",
        "The primary purpose of the __call__ method is to define behavior for when an instance of a class is invoked like a function. This is useful when you want an object to perform some action when it is \"called\" directly, without needing to use explicit method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "When you define __call__ in a class, Python allows instances of that class to be called using parentheses, just like a function. The __call__ method gets invoked when you use the parentheses syntax, and you can define what should happen inside this method."
